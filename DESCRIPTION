Description: TauDEM is a set of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tools for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information
    from topography as represented by a DEM.TauDEM is software developed at Utah State University (USU) for hydrologic digital
    elevation model analysis and watershed delineation and may be obtained from http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/.
    The architecture of TauDEM separates the system into a set of command line executable functions that comprise the engine
    that does the work, and a graphic user interface developed as a toolbox for ArcGIS.The ArcGIS toolbox uses system calls
    to run these functions so running these functions from the command line, which is possible in R via system () and shell ()
    functions, produces exactly the same output as an equivalent ArcGIS toolbox function. To use TauDEM command line functions
    you need the TauDEM 5.3 software as well as MPI software. Our current Windows PC precompiled executables have been compiled
    using the Microsoft HPC Pack 2012 MS-MPI libraries from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36045.
    MPICH2 libraries are suggested for non-Windows installations.The installation instructions along with the list of required
    dependencies for running TauDEM can be found at http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/downloads.html.
